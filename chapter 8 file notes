Files

Talking to text files which are thought of as a sequence of lines.

Reading things that are permanent and writing back. 

Read a file we call the open() function. 
Makes it possible that you can read the file doesn't actually do the reading of the file. 

filehandle = open(filename, mode)
	modes: open, read, write, close

fhand = open('mbox.txt')
print(fhand)

NEWLINE CHARACTER
\n indicates that a new line is created.

print() always puts a new line in. 

\n counts as a character
	stuff = 'X\nY'
	print(stuff)
		X
		Y
	len(stuff)
		3

FILE HANDLE AS A SEQUENCE

fhand = open('mbox.txt')
for cheese in xfile:
	print(cheese)
	
COUNTING LINES IN A FILE
fhand = open('mbox.txt')
count = 0 
for cheese in xfile:
count = count + 1
	print('Line Count:', count)

#if saved in a file called open.py we can run: 
	python3 open.py

and will return: 
	Line Count: 132045
